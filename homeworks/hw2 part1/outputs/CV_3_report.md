# CV Verification Report - CV_3.pdf

**Person:** Wei Zhang
**Overall Status:** partially_verified
**Confidence:** 0.47

## Selected Profiles
- LinkedIn: {'platform': 'linkedin', 'candidate_id': '3827', 'display_name': 'Wei Zhang', 'profile_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/3827', 'score': 0.7, 'reason': "Name and location match (Wei Zhang, Munich, Germany). Current employer is PwC, which matches the CV company. However, LinkedIn shows a healthcare-focused profile with title 'Scientist' and a PhD from Harvard, while the CV describes a consulting/strategy-oriented engineer with a BSc from University of Tokyo, so there are significant discrepancies in education and role focus."}
- Facebook: {'platform': 'facebook', 'candidate_id': '97', 'display_name': 'Wei Zhang', 'profile_url': 'https://www.facebook.com/97', 'score': 0.85, 'reason': "Name and city match (Wei Zhang, Munich, Germany). Profile bio mentions 'Consulting' and current job shows 'Engineer' at PwC, aligning closely with the CV's company (PwC) and title (Engineer). Education level is a bachelor's degree, compatible with a BSc. This is the strongest overall match."}

## Summary
The Facebook candidate (ID 97) strongly aligns with the CV on name, city (Munich), employer (PwC), and title (Engineer), and indicates a bachelor’s-level education compatible with a BSc, which supports that the person and core work history are plausible. However, none of the LinkedIn profiles match the CV’s combination of consulting focus, single long tenure at PwC since 2013, and BSc in Consulting from the University of Tokyo; they show conflicting senior education (PhDs/MSc) and different industries or timelines. The unusual degree description ('BSc in Consulting' from the University of Tokyo) and the lack of strong, corroborating professional profiles introduce some doubt. Overall, the identity and current role at PwC in Munich are moderately supported, but specific education details and exact career narrative cannot be confidently verified.
