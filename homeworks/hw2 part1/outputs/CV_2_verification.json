However, education (McGill University PhD) does not match the CV's University of Hong Kong BSc, and work history (Carousell, Bank of East Asia, Traveloka) does not match Tencent or BCG. Treated as a weak, low‑confidence candidate."

    "reason": "Name matches and current city is Beijing with hometown Hong Kong, which aligns with the CV’s location hints (Beijing, China; Hong Kong). However, public info shows an engineering role at Manulife and interests in Machine Learning rather than design, and there is no clear evidence of UI/UX, graphic design, Tencent, or BCG. Weak but geographically consistent candidate."

  "summary": "No social or professional profile clearly matches the CV’s combined pattern of design-focused background, Tencent analyst experience (2013–2017), and a manager role at BCG from 2022 onward with a BSc in Design from the University of Hong Kong. All retrieved LinkedIn candidates either diverge significantly in education (e.g., McGill, PolyU), work history (Carousell, ByteDance, EY, banking/legal/education), or lack any Tencent/BCG linkage, despite some overlap in location or design skills. Facebook profiles provide some geographic consistency with Beijing/Hong Kong but display careers in engineering, finance, or other non-design fields, and none shows Tencent or BCG experience or HKU design education. Because every candidate is at best a weak partial match and there is no corroborating evidence for the specific work history and education claims, the CV details cannot be confidently verified. The case is therefore classified as unable_to_verify rather than suspicious, given the commonality of the name and potential for missing or private profiles."
