# CV Verification Report - CV_4.pdf

**Person:** Rahul Sharma
**Overall Status:** unable_to_verify
**Confidence:** 0.95

## Selected Profiles
- LinkedIn: {'platform': 'linkedin', 'candidate_id': '9660', 'display_name': 'Rahul Sharma', 'profile_url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/9660', 'score': 0.4, 'reason': "Name and Singapore location match CV hints, and industry is Legal, which loosely aligns with the candidate's legal/compliance background. However, detailed profile data could not be retrieved (tool error), so no confirmation of Microsoft or Tsinghua University, and no evidence of Web3/ML/quantum or Senior Engineer role. Included as a weak candidate due to lack of better matches."}
- Facebook: {'platform': 'facebook', 'candidate_id': '765', 'display_name': 'Rahul Sharma', 'profile_url': 'https://www.facebook.com/765', 'score': 0.5, 'reason': 'Name matches and profile is based in Singapore, which aligns strongly with CV. However, current company is Shopee as Manager, no indication of Microsoft, legal/compliance, or Tsinghua University. Included as the strongest Facebook candidate only because of exact name and Singapore location, but employment mismatch keeps confidence moderate.'}

## Summary
The CV claims a PhD in Legal Studies from Tsinghua University (2021) and a Senior Engineer role at Microsoft from 2021–2027, along with consulting for a startup, but no retrieved social profile corroborates any of these key elements. Multiple Rahul Sharma profiles were found in Singapore and the Philippines, yet none shows Microsoft employment, Tsinghua education, or a clear legal/compliance plus senior engineering combination. The best‑matched LinkedIn and Facebook candidates align only on name and general location, with job histories (Shopee, UrbanFlow, etc.) that conflict with the Microsoft/legal narrative. The presence of overlapping dates (2021–2027 at Microsoft vs. 2020–2023 at StartupXYZ) and the far‑future end date 2027 add to the uncertainty. Overall, there is insufficient external evidence to confirm the CV, but no direct disproving evidence for this specific identity either, so it remains largely unverified.
